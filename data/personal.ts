  summary:
    'I scaled a B2B handloom marketplace from 20 to 45+ vendors in 9 months — growing GMV 2x to INR 15L+, improving seller activation 30–35%, and building the analytics infrastructure to sustain it. My edge: I\'ve run SQL queries on retention cohorts and sat face-to-face with artisans who\'d never used a smartphone. Data tells you the what. Users tell you the why. I close that gap. CSPO certified. M.S. Management of Technology at ASU, GPA 3.6.',
